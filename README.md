Develop a desktop application that allows a user to register an account by email and password or through his/her existing google account. We attach a mock of the interface that we ask you to reproduce as close as you can. The application layout has to be responsive, please note that we have included 2 layout for two different window sizes.



To log with Solodata.es API:

To register a log normally:
complete the inputs with your email and password then click on register. The data its going to be save in the local storage, then you can log in, if the passwrod and email matchs with those you entered before, the page will be redirect to the landing page.
