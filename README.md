Desktop application made with Vue.js that allows a user to register an account by email and password or loggin by solodataAPI. The application layout is responsive, I added some styles with Bulma.io.



To log with Solodata.es API:
email : usuario1@gmail.com
password: 123456

the user: usuario7@gmail.com is inactive, you can test it and see the differents messages.

To register a log normally:
complete the inputs with your email and password then click on register. The data its going to be save in the local storage, then you can log in, if the passwrod and email matchs with those you entered before, the page will be redirect to the landing page.
